"""
Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR) collision detection algorithm.

This module implements the MPR algorithm for detecting collisions between convex shapes
and computing signed distance and contact information. MPR is an alternative to the
GJK+EPA approach that can be more efficient for penetrating contacts.

The algorithm works by:
1. Constructing an initial portal (triangle) in Minkowski space that contains the origin
2. Iteratively refining the portal by moving it closer to the origin
3. Computing signed distance and contact points once the origin is enclosed

Key features:
- Works directly with penetrating contacts (no need for EPA as a separate step)
- More numerically stable than EPA for deep penetrations
- Returns collision normal, signed distance, and witness points
- Supports feature ID tracking for contact persistence

The implementation uses support mapping to query shape geometry, making it applicable
to any convex shape that provides a support function.
